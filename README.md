# TIS-200
Congratulations on your purchase of the TIS-200, TIS-200+, TIS-200.5, TIS-200.5+, TIS-201, TIS-201+, and/or TIS-201\* software packages! These packages give users access to the powerful node-based architecture of the original TIS-100 system. Rather than using physical nodes with all those pesky wires and circuits, however, TIS-200 utilizes cutting-edge Web 2.0 quantum reticulated-spline semiconductor technology to temporarily repurpose your computer's existing wires and circuits and *simulate* said node-based architecture--all from the comfort of your own home/workplace/cardboard box!

For more information on setup, usage, or other functions of the TIS-200 software, please consult the files in the `manual/` directory.
